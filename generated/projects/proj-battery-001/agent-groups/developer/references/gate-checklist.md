# Hard Gate Checklist

1. Citation gate: all key claims include citations.
2. Consistency gate: assumptions are explicit and contradiction-free.
3. Scope gate: output remains within specialist boundary.
4. Reproducibility gate: steps, parameters, and artifacts are included.

Block conditions:
- Missing citations for key claims -> `BLOCKED_UNCITED`
- Required web evidence unavailable -> `BLOCKED_NEEDS_EVIDENCE`
- Internal contradiction -> `BLOCKED_INCONSISTENT`
- Scope violation -> `BLOCKED_SCOPE`
