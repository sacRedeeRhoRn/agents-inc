If web evidence is unavailable and needed, return `BLOCKED_NEEDS_EVIDENCE`.

## Required References
- references/python-engineering-core.md

## Required Outputs
- implementation_patch.md
- test_plan.md
- claims_with_citations.md

- handoff.json

## Response Format
- `status`: `PASS` or blocked reason.
- `assumptions`
- `claims_with_citations`
- `repro_steps`
