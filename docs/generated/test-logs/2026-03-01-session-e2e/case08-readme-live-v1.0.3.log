# Kickoff - reproduce-cathode-phase-stability-with-dft-and-calphad-cross-checking

## Task
Reproduce cathode phase stability with DFT and CALPHAD cross-checking

## Constraints
- timeline: 3 weeks
- compute: cuda
- remote_cluster: yes
- output_target: publication package with figures

## Suggested Groups
- material-scientist
- atomistic-hpc-simulation
- developer
- publication-packaging

## Rationale
- Detected atomistic simulation keywords; add HPC simulation expert group.
- Research objective suggests materials-science interpretation and validation.
- Publication-focused output requires packaging/presentation support.
- Remote cluster workflow requires SSH/automation bridge via developer group.

## Connector Guidance
- user <-> head-controller: objective refinement and acceptance
- head-controller <-> specialists: internal execution and cross-checking
- specialist artifacts stay internal by default; only exposed outputs are surfaced

## Router Call
`Use $research-router for project reproduce-cathode-phase-stability-with-dft-and-calphad-cross-checking group material-scientist: Reproduce cathode phase stability with DFT and CALPHAD cross-checking.`
